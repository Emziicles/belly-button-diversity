# Belly Button Biodiversity
## Interactive Web Visualisations Homework

### The assignment

In this assignment, we are building an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

### The components of the website

Firstly, we have a dropdown menu, where we can select the test subject ID no. This alters the data present on the webpage to the relevant data.

Secondly, we have a table that shows the metadata of the test subject, including ethnicity, gender and age.

There are two graph components, a bubble chart and a horizontal bar chart. The horizontal bar chart shows the top 10 most prevelant bacteria present within the sample. Hovering over the bar will show the bacteria family and species that it represents.

The bubble chart shows the numbers of bacteria per sample, as well as the family and species of the bacteria.

### Additional Info

Following this, I went back to look at the results on the website. The most prevelant bacteria, are Corynebacterium and Staphylococcus, both of which, unsurprisingly, can be part of normal human skin flora. However, certain species of those bacteria can also cause very bad infections, a species of Corynebacterium is the causative agent of diptheria and Staphylococcus species can cause a wide variety of infections/diseases, including food poisoning and sepsis. The take-away from this project being don't put your finger in your mouth after scratching your belly button!
